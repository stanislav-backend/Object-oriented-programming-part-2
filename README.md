# C++ Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains practice implementations of classic data structures and algorithms using C++. Each file demonstrates a focused concept, with clean and educational code aimed at improving understanding of core topics in computer science.

## Contents

### Data Structures

- Priority Queues and Heaps  
  Manual implementation of min/max heaps and priority queues.

- Treap (Cartesian Tree)  
  A randomized balanced binary search tree combining properties of a BST and a heap.

### Graph Algorithms

- Graph Traversal  
  Basic traversal algorithms including Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

- Maximum Flow  
  Implementation of max flow algorithms such as Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp.

- Hamiltonian Path  
  Backtracking solution to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph.
